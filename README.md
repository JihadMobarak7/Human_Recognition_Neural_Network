# Human_Recognition_Neural_Network
This repository contains a project that applies a simple feed-forward neural network to perform human activity recognition based on smartphone sensor data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various attributes derived from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone, labeled with activities like walking, sitting, standing, etc.
